# SAP Automation with PyAutoGUI

This project is an automation tool developed using Python and the `pyautogui` library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons to automate interactions with SAP, streamlining login and specific transaction processes.

---

## Features

### GUI Functionalities
1. **Login SAP**:
   - Automatically opens SAP using the specified path and logs into the system using credentials stored in a local Excel spreadsheet.
   - The login process includes opening SAP, filling in the username and password, and pressing "Enter" to log in.
   - The credentials are fetched from a local file (`usuario.xlsx`), located at my local `Documents`, you must change to yours.

2. **Transaction 1301**:
   - Automates the process of entering transaction 1301, performing predefined steps, and exporting the results to a predefined directory.

3. **Transaction 2301**:
   - Automates the process of entering transaction 2301, performing predefined steps, and exporting the results to a predefined directory.

### Additional Functions (Not Assigned to Buttons)
- **Transaction FMEDDW**: Prepares and automates steps for FMEDDW.
- **Transaction FMRP**: Prepares and automates steps for FMRP.

> Note: The FMEDDW and FMRP functionalities are implemented in the code but are not currently linked to any button in the GUI.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For image recognition and automation of keyboard/mouse actions.
- **Tkinter**: To create the GUI for user interaction.
- **Pandas**: For reading user credentials from a local Excel file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.x installed on your machine.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pyautogui pandas
     ```

2. **SAP Installed**:
   - Ensure that SAP is installed and accessible from your machine.

3. **Local Spreadsheet**:
   - Create a spreadsheet containing user login credentials in the following format:
     |  usuario |   senha  |
     |----------|----------|
     |   user1  |   pass1  |
     - Save the file locally at your defined `login` at `loginSAP.py` file.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python sap_automation.py
     ```

2. **Use the GUI**:
   - **Login SAP**: Click this button to log into SAP automatically. The login credentials will be read from the `usuario.xlsx` file, and the login process will be performed with `pyautogui` and `fcs` functions.
   - **1301**: Automates transaction 1301 and saves the output to the predefined directory.
   - **2301**: Automates transaction 2301 and saves the output to the predefined directory.

## Limitations and Notes

- **Transaction-Specific Steps**:
  - Ensure that the SAP screens are set up correctly for the automation to work.
  - Modifications might be required if SAP UI elements differ due to customization.

- **GUI Buttons for FMEDDW and FMRP**:
  - These functionalities are coded but not linked to any GUI buttons. To use them, assign them to new buttons in the GUI or execute them manually from the code.

- **Login Credentials**:
  - The login credentials must be stored in the file `usuario.xlsx` located at `C:\Users\jbtesch\Documents\usuario.xlsx`. Ensure the file format is correct.
